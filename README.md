## üì¶ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository (optional for local use)**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JyotikaUppar/CodSoft.git
   cd CodSoft
   ````

2. **Run on Google Colab**

   * Open the respective notebook (`Titanic.ipynb`, `MoviePrediction.ipynb`, `FraudDetection.ipynb`) in **Google Colab**.
   * All dependencies can be installed directly inside the notebook with `!pip install ...`.

---

## üìä Data & Datasets

* Each project includes its dataset in the repository or provides links in the notebook.
* Preprocessing steps include handling missing values, normalization, feature engineering, and dealing with class imbalance.

---

## üìã Evaluation & Metrics

* **Classification tasks (Titanic, Fraud Detection):**
  Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC, Precision-Recall Curve.

* **Regression / Prediction (Movie Ratings):**
  RMSE, MAE.

---

## üñº Visualizations

* Distribution plots of features and target classes.
* Boxplots and histograms for exploratory data analysis.
* Heatmaps for correlation analysis.
* Feature importance plots to explain models.
* Precision-Recall curves for fraud detection.

---

## üîç Why These Projects?

These projects showcase:

* Real-world challenges (imbalanced fraud dataset).
* Core ML techniques (classification, regression, resampling, ensembles).
* Practical coding + EDA + visualizations.
* Model explainability (feature importance).

---

## üß≠ Future Enhancements

* Try deep learning (ANNs, Autoencoders) for fraud detection.
* Deploy models as APIs (Flask/FastAPI).
* Automate hyperparameter tuning with GridSearch/Optuna.
* Expand movie rating prediction into a recommendation system.
