# CodSoft Internship Projects

This repository contains my Data Science internship projects completed at CodSoft. The projects demonstrate my proficiency in Python programming and machine learning techniques applied to real-world datasets.

## üìÅ Projects Overview

### 1. Titanic Survival Prediction

* **Description**: Developed a machine learning model to predict passenger survival on the Titanic based on various features.
* **Technologies Used**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
* **Key Learnings**: Data preprocessing, feature engineering, model evaluation

### 2. Movie Rating Prediction

* **Description**: Built a recommendation system to predict movie ratings for users based on historical data.
* **Technologies Used**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Surprise Library
* **Key Learnings**: Collaborative filtering, model tuning, cross-validation

### 3. Iris Flower Classification

* **Description**: Implemented a classification model to identify species of iris flowers using the famous Iris dataset.
* **Technologies Used**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn
* **Key Learnings**: Supervised learning, data visualization, model evaluation metrics

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Languages**: Python
* **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Surprise
* **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebook

## üöÄ Getting Started

To run these projects locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JyotikaUppar/CodSoft.git
   cd CodSoft
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Titanic.ipynb
   ```

   Repeat the last step for other notebooks as needed.
